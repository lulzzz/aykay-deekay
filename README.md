# akdk
AK/DK - an Akka.NET extension for interacting with the Docker API

Note - this is a work-in-progress. Please feel free to open an issue for questions for feedback; I'm off hiking from May 17th to June 6th 2017 (so apologies in advance if I'm slow to reply), but when I get back it'll be full steam ahead :)

For usage examples, see [here](test/AKDK.TestHarness/Program.cs) or [here](examples/orchestration/Program.cs).
